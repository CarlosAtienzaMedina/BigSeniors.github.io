  <h2> BIG SENIORS: LIGHT TO LONELY HEARTS</h2>
	
	<center><h3> "Big Seniors" project arises as a response to a worrying reality: loneliness in the elderly. Aware of the emotional challenges faced by many lonely seniors, we have created an initiative dedicated to providing companionship, emotional support and a network of care for those who feel isolated in our community.</h3></center>
	
  <h3 class="titles"> OBJECTIVE AND APPROACH</h3>
	
  <center><h5> The main goal of Big Seniors is to provide a supportive and companionship environment for lonely seniors. We focus on establishing meaningful and lasting connections between volunteers and seniors, creating a network of care based on empathy, understanding and affection.</h5></center>

  <h3 class="titles">EMOTIONAL SUPPORT</h3>
	
<center><h5> Our emotional companionship program focuses on pairing committed and compassionate volunteers with seniors in need of companionship and support. These volunteers become close friends, offering their time to talk, listen, do activities together and provide a shoulder in difficult times. We believe that the simple act of being present and sharing experiences can make a big difference in the lives of lonely seniors.</h5></center>

These activities can include discussion groups, cultural outings, creative workshops, gentle exercise classes and much more. Our goal is to create an inclusive and welcoming space where seniors can feel valued, connected and part of a caring community. </h5></center>

  <center><h5> Big Seniors also provides additional resources and support to meet the specific needs of lonely seniors. This may include information about transportation services, assistance accessing health care services, wellness program recommendations, and financial resources for those facing financial hardship. We strive to be a trusted and caring resource for our seniors, ensuring they receive the support they need to live full and satisfying lives.
		  
		  Impact and Results
		  
		  The impact of Big Seniors is reflected in improving emotional well-being, reducing loneliness and strengthening community connection among lonely seniors. </h5></center>
					 
		<center><h5>Our goal is to create an environment where each senior feels valued, accompanied and supported at all stages of their life.
		  
		  In short, Big Seniors is more than a project; is a network of care and companionship intended to illuminate the lonely hearts of our dear elderly. With the continued commitment of our volunteers and the support of the community, we hope to make a significant difference in the lives of those who need it most. </h5></center>
